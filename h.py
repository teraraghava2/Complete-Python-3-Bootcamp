Significance of Using All-MiniLM-L6-v2 for Cosine Similarity Calculation

1. Introduction to the Model

For this analysis, you have used the all-mpnet-base-v2 model to compute cosine similarity scores between call transcripts and model-generated summaries. This model is a part of the Sentence Transformers (SBERT) family, optimized for semantic similarity and dense vector embeddings.

The all-mpnet-base-v2 model is a transformer-based sentence embedding model trained using a contrastive learning approach. It is pre-trained on millions of sentence pairs, making it highly effective for capturing the semantic meaning of text.

2. Why All-MPNet-Base-V2 for Cosine Similarity?

The model is designed specifically for dense vector representations of sentences, making it ideal for tasks like semantic search, paraphrase detection, and text similarity calculations. Key reasons for choosing this model are:
	1.	Superior Semantic Understanding
	•	Unlike traditional TF-IDF or BOW (Bag-of-Words) models, all-mpnet-base-v2 captures contextual meaning rather than just keyword overlap.
	•	It generates dense embeddings where similar sentences cluster closely in vector space.
	2.	Robust Contextual Embeddings
	•	The model maps sentences with similar meanings to closer points in vector space, ensuring that semantically related transcripts and summaries yield high cosine similarity scores.
	•	It reduces reliance on exact word matches, which is crucial for paraphrased summaries.
	3.	Optimized for Short and Long Texts
	•	The model performs well on both short summaries and longer transcript chunks, making it ideal for chunk-wise cosine similarity evaluations.
	4.	Efficient and Scalable
	•	It has a smaller footprint compared to larger models like BERT-large, making it more efficient for large-scale computations across 6707 records.
	•	Inference is faster, allowing for seamless evaluation across different chunk sizes.

3. How Cosine Similarity Works with MPNet Embeddings

The cosine similarity metric measures how similar two vectors are in high-dimensional space. The all-mpnet-base-v2 model transforms text into dense 768-dimensional embeddings, where:
	•	Highly similar summaries and transcript chunks have embeddings with a smaller angular distance, leading to higher cosine similarity scores (closer to 1.0).
	•	Unrelated or randomly assigned summaries have embeddings with a larger angular distance, resulting in lower cosine similarity scores (closer to 0.0).

The formula for cosine similarity is:

￼

where:
	•	A and B are the embedding vectors for the transcript chunk and summary.
	•	The numerator represents the dot product between the two vectors.
	•	The denominator normalizes them by their magnitudes.

Since MPNet embeddings capture deep semantic meaning, cosine similarity with this model is more reliable than traditional lexical methods.

4. Impact of Chunk Size on Cosine Similarity Scores

Because the all-mpnet-base-v2 model is context-sensitive, the way transcript chunks are constructed directly impacts similarity scores:
	1.	Smaller Chunks (25-70 Tokens) → Higher Similarity
	•	Since the chunk contains a more focused context, it aligns better with the summary, leading to higher cosine similarity scores.
	•	MPNet’s embeddings can efficiently capture meaning in short contexts without dilution.
	2.	Larger Chunks (100+ Tokens) → Slightly Lower Similarity
	•	As chunks get larger, more irrelevant content gets mixed in, causing a gradual decline in cosine similarity.
	•	The model finds it harder to match the summary to a specific part of the transcript, reducing similarity scores.
	3.	Cosine Similarity vs. Random Baseline
	•	The random baseline scores are consistently lower, proving that MPNet embeddings preserve semantic relationships between summaries and transcripts.
	•	Without contextual alignment (random summaries), MPNet assigns lower similarity scores, demonstrating the model’s ability to differentiate meaningful summaries from random text.

5. Advantages Over Other Models

Compared to other similarity models, all-mpnet-base-v2 offers:
