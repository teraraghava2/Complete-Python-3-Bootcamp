Additional Instructions:
	•	Use these criteria as guidelines to ensure a realistic and human-like judgment of transcript and summary quality.
	•	Prioritize balance and consistency in your ratings, avoiding over-perfectionism or undue harshness.
	•	Consider contextual nuances and practical limits in human evaluations, recognizing that not all aspects of a summary or transcript will always align perfectly.

This prompt reduces over-stringency by explicitly allowing room for small errors or imperfections, thus increasing alignment with human evaluation tendencies. It sets a realistic standard for scoring and reflects the variability in human judgment. kk
